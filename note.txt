Adding get Loan by ID controller

It extracts the loan ID from the URL parameters (req.params.id).

It searches the database for a loan with that ID and includes the user's name and email.

If no loan is found, it returns a 404 error with the message "Loan not found".

If the loan exists, it sends the loan data back in the response.

This route is protected, meaning only authenticated users can access it.
