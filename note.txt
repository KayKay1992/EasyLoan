Adding update loan status controller


t extracts the loan ID and new status from the request.

It checks if the new status is valid based on allowed values.

It finds the loan by ID and returns a 404 error if not found.

It ensures only an admin can update the loan's status.

If valid, it updates the status (and dates if applicable), saves, and returns the updated loan.
