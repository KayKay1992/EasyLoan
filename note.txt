Integrating getSettings controller


âœ… Explanation (in brief):
It fetches the most recent settings document using .findOne().sort({ updatedAt: -1 }).

If no settings are found, it returns a 404 error.

Otherwise, it returns the settings data with a success message.

You can mark this route as public or protected based on your needs (e.g., admin panel vs. public frontend).
