Integrating create repayment controller

Here's a 10-line explanation of the `createRepayment` controller:

1. It starts by extracting repayment details (`loanId`, `amountPaid`, `paymentMethod`, `dueDate`) from the request body.
2. It checks that all required fields are present; if not, it throws an error.
3. The controller verifies that the specified loan exists.
4. It ensures the logged-in user owns the loan to prevent unauthorized access.
5. It only allows repayment if the loan status is `"active"`.
6. It ensures the repayment amount doesn’t exceed the remaining loan balance.
7. It determines whether the repayment is `"late"` or `"paid"` based on the due date.
8. It creates a repayment record with a unique reference ID.
9. It updates the loan’s repayment balance and status (to `"completed"` if fully paid).
10. It returns a response with the repayment details, remaining balance, and updated loan status.
