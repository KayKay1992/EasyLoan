Get current user function integration in auth controller

Explanation:
Middleware (protect) ensures that the route is protected and the user is authenticated, attaching the user’s data (like user._id) to the req.user object.

The controller uses User.findById(req.user._id) to fetch the current user’s data from the database, excluding the password for security (.select('-password')).

If no user is found, it throws a 404 error.

If the user is found, it returns the user details (e.g., name, email, role, profile image) in the response.
