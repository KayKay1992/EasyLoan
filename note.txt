Defining loan mongodb schema

Here’s a full and clean definition of a Loan schema using Mongoose — tailored for a loan management system in a MERN stack project.

🔍 Field Breakdown
Field	Description
user	Reference to the user who took the loan
amount	Principal loan amount
interestRate	Interest rate for this loan (e.g. 5%)
termMonths	Loan duration in months
monthlyPayment	Monthly installment amount (can be calculated at approval)
totalRepayable	Total amount user will repay (principal + interest)
status	Current status of the loan
startDate	When the loan starts (on approval)
endDate	When the loan should end
createdAt	When the loan application was created

✅ Why This Schema Works
Tracks everything from application to final repayment
Connects easily with Repayments, Transactions, and User
