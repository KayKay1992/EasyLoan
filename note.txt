Update user profile function integration in auth controller

1. The `updateUserProfile` function retrieves the current user from the database using `req.user.id`, which is set by the auth middleware.  
2. If the user isn't found, it returns a **404 Not Found** error.  
3. It updates the user's `name`, `email`, and `role` only if new values are provided in the request body.  
4. If a new `password` is provided, it hashes it using `bcrypt` before saving it.  
5. The updated user data is then saved to the database using `user.save()`.  
6. After saving, it returns the updated user info along with a fresh JWT token.  
7. This allows users to manage and update their own profile securely.
