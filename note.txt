Adding Admin Dashboard controller


Fetch Basic Statistics: It counts the total number of loans and segregates them based on loan statuses (pending, approved, active, etc.).

Loan Distribution by Status: Aggregates loans by status (such as pending, approved, etc.) and returns this data in a consistent format.

Loan Types Distribution: It aggregates the loans by loan types (e.g., personal, business) and returns the count of each type.

Recent Loans: Retrieves the 10 most recent loans to display recent loan activity on the admin dashboard.

Return Data: Sends a comprehensive JSON response with loan statistics, loan status distribution, loan type distribution, and recent loans.

Error Handling: If something goes wrong during data fetching, an error message is logged and a server error response is sent.

This approach provides a detailed view of loan status, types, and recent activity for the admin to monitor the loan system effectively.
