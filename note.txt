Integrating updateSettings controller


Explanation:
Fetch existing settings: The code first looks for an existing settings document in the database.

If settings are found: It updates the settings with any new values passed in the request body. If a value is not provided, it keeps the existing value.

Update timestamp: The updatedAt field is updated to the current date to track when the settings were last modified.

Save and respond: After updating, the changes are saved to the database, and a success message with the updated settings is sent back to the client.

This allows admins to adjust system-wide loan terms, interest rates, and penalties dynamically.
