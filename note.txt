Integrating the getAllTransactions controller.

Sure! Here's a 5-line explanation of the `getAllTransactions` controller:

1. This controller retrieves all transaction records from the database.  
2. It uses Mongoose's `populate()` to include user name/email and loan details in the response.  
3. Only admins should have access to this route for security reasons.  
4. The result is returned as a JSON response with a success message.  
5. It's wrapped in `asyncHandler` to handle async errors cleanly.
