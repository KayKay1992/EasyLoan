. Explaing applyForLoan Controller

Hereâ€™s a 15-line explanation of the updated `applyForLoan` controller:

1. The controller handles a loan application from an authenticated user.  
2. It extracts necessary fields from the request body, including loan and contact details.  
3. It calculates a date 3 months in the past to check recent defaults.  
4. It checks if the user has any defaulted loans within the last 3 months.  
5. If a recent default is found, it blocks the loan application and returns a 403 error.  
6. It calculates the **monthly interest rate** from the annual `interestRate`.  
7. Using the **PMT formula**, it computes the monthly repayment amount.  
8. The total amount repayable is calculated by multiplying monthly payment by duration.  
9. A new loan document is created in the database using all the provided and calculated data.  
10. Bank details (name, account number, etc.) are stored for future disbursement.  
11. Contact information (phone, email, preferred method) is also saved.  
12. If verification documents were uploaded, their paths are saved in the `documents` field.  
13. After successful creation, a 201 response is sent back with a success message.  
14. The full loan record is included in the response so the frontend can show it immediately.  
15. This process ensures validation, risk control (via default check), and proper loan setup.
