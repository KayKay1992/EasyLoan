login user function integration in auth controller

1. The `loginUser` function extracts the `email` and `password` from the request body to handle user login.
2. It checks if a **user exists** with the provided email, returning a **401 error** if no user is found.
3. It compares the **entered password** with the stored hashed password using `bcrypt.compare()`, returning a **401 error** if they donâ€™t match.
4. If the password is correct, the user data (e.g., name, email, role) is returned in the response.
5. Along with the user data, a **JWT token** is generated and returned for **authentication**.
