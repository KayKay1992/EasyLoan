get users by idfunction controller

Itâ€™s an async function wrapped with asyncHandler to handle errors automatically.

It uses User.findById() to find a user by the ID in the request URL.

The .select("-password") ensures the password field is excluded from the response.

If no user is found, it returns a 404 error with a "user not found" message.

If the user exists, it sends the user data as a JSON response.
