Integrating the getTransactionById controller.

Sure! Here's an 8-line explanation of the `getTransactionById` controller:

1. It defines an async route handler to fetch a specific transaction by its ID from the database.  
2. `req.params.id` is used to extract the transaction ID from the request URL.  
3. `Transaction.findById()` searches for the transaction in the database.  
4. It uses `.populate()` to include user details (name, email) and loan info in the response.  
5. If no transaction is found, a 404 error is thrown.  
6. If found, it returns a success response with the transaction data.  
7. The response includes a helpful message and the transaction details.  
8. The route is meant for admin or the user who owns the transaction (based on access control).
