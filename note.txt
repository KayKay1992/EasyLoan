Integrating apiPath.js

This `API_PATHS` object in `apiPaths.js` centralizes all the API endpoint paths used across your frontend app. Here's a 10-line breakdown:

1. `BASE_URL` defines the root of your API server (`http://localhost:3000`).
2. `API_PATHS` organizes all endpoint paths grouped by feature (e.g., `AUTH`, `USERS`, `LOANS`).
3. Each group contains routes as constants (like `REGISTER`, `LOGIN`) or functions (for dynamic routes).
4. `AUTH` handles user authentication: register, login, get/update profile.
5. `USERS` is for user management: get all users, get/delete user by ID (admin only).
6. `LOANS` includes endpoints for loan operations like create, update, delete, and apply.
7. `TRANSACTION` covers creating, updating, retrieving, and deleting financial transactions.
8. `REPAYMENT` deals with repayment recordsâ€”CRUD operations and fetching by user or loan.
9. `NOTIFICATION` supports creating, fetching, marking, and deleting user notifications.
10. This setup improves maintainability by avoiding hard-coded URLs scattered across the app.

Let me know if you want to auto-prefix these with `BASE_URL` in actual requests.
