Adding Transaction routes registering the route in server.js and creating the Transaction conroller skeleton 

Transaction routes explained.
Sure! Here's a **10-line explanation** of the code:

1. These routes manage loan-related financial transactions (like disbursements, payments).
2. `POST /api/transactions` lets **admins** create a new transaction (e.g., when approving a loan).
3. `GET /api/transactions` allows **admins** to view all transactions in the system.
4. `GET /api/transactions/:id` lets **admins** fetch a specific transaction by its ID.
5. `PUT /api/transactions/:id` is for **admins** to update a transaction's details (e.g., status).
6. `DELETE /api/transactions/:id` enables **admins** to remove a transaction record.
7. `GET /api/transactions/user/:userId` allows **admins** to view all transactions by a specific user.
8. `GET /api/transactions/loan/:loanId` can be accessed by **both admins and users** (for their own loans) to view related transactions.
9. Middleware like `protect` ensures only authenticated users access the routes, and `adminOnly` limits actions to admins.
10. This setup maintains a secure and well-structured transaction system within a loan management app.
