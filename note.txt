Integrating getUnreadNotification controller


10-Line Explanation:
This controller fetches all unread notifications for the currently authenticated user.

It retrieves the user's ID from the req.user object (assuming authentication middleware is in place).

It queries the Notification collection where user matches and isRead is false.

The results are sorted by createdAt in descending order (most recent first).

It returns a JSON response with a success message and the notifications.

The total key provides the count of unread notifications.

This allows users to be alerted of new or unseen events (e.g., loan status, repayments).

Useful for showing notification badges in the UI.

Ensures users donâ€™t miss important actions or alerts in the system.

Helps drive engagement by showing up-to-date info about their loan activities.

Let me know if you want to add pagination or mark notifications as read!
