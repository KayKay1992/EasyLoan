Create Notification logic

Your createNotification controller logic looks solid! Here's a quick 10-line explanation of what it's doing:

It extracts type, title, message, and userId from the request body.

It validates that all required fields are present.

It ensures the type is one of the allowed enum values: "system", "reminder", or "alert".

It checks if the user exists using the provided userId.

If the user doesn't exist, it throws a 404 error.

If everything is valid, it creates a new notification in the database.

It defaults the notification's read status to false and adds a createdAt timestamp.

It responds with a 201 Created status.

The created notification object is returned in the response.

This route is secured for Admin use only (as noted in the comment).
