Getting our jwt secret key,setting the authmiddleware, and initializing the authroute in server.js

to generate the secret key we run this function in our terminal and copy the values generated to our .env file saved in JWT_SECRET variable node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))".

****    
We import our auth controllers to the auth route.

***
We then create the authMidlleware which houses both protect and adminOnly middleware.
we make sure we use the protected routes as where it should be in our routes.

***
Initialise the auth route in srver.js and make sure it is imported.
