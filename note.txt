Integrating Settings


Hereâ€™s a 10-line explanation of the **Settings** module: model, routes, and controller skeleton:

1. The **Settings model** defines key configurations for the loan system, like interest rate, loan terms, max/min amounts, penalties, etc.
2. It uses a Mongoose schema with sensible defaults (e.g., 5% interest, 7-day grace period).
3. The model allows central configuration control for how loans behave in the app.
4. The **routes file** includes endpoints to get, create, and update settings.
5. `GET /api/settings` allows users/admins to retrieve the current system configuration.
6. `POST /api/settings` is for initial setup (only used once or restricted to admin).
7. `PUT /api/settings` allows updating values (like changing interest rate) by admin.
8. The **controller skeleton** prepares the logic for each route but leaves implementations blank for now.
9. It uses `asyncHandler` to handle async/await with error catching.
10. Together, this module gives the app flexible and maintainable control over financial rules and configurations.

Let me know if you want to auto-load settings during loan creation or display them in the dashboard.
