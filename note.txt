Integrating getAllNotification controller


Quick Explanation (10 Lines):
This controller gets all notifications for the authenticated user.

It retrieves the user ID from req.user._id, assuming auth middleware is set.

It queries the Notification model to find all records for that user.

It sorts the results by createdAt so the most recent appears first.

It doesn't filter by isRead, so both read and unread are returned.

The response includes a message, the total count, and the notifications themselves.

This is useful for a full notifications page or history section in the app.

Can be combined with filters like type or date later if needed.

Helps users stay updated on all loan and repayment activities.

Easy to extend with pagination or searching by message/type.
