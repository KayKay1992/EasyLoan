Integrating the deleteTransaction controller.

! Here's a 7-line explanation of the deleteTransaction controller:

The function deletes a transaction based on the ID provided in the request URL.

It uses express-async-handler to handle asynchronous errors cleanly.

It fetches the transaction from the database using findById.

If the transaction doesn't exist, it sends a 404 error response.

If found, it deletes the transaction from the database using deleteOne().

A success response is returned with a confirmation message and the deleted ID.

This route should be protected so only admins can perform this action.
