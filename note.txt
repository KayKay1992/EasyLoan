SETTING THE STRUCTURE OF LOAN CONTROLLER

This structure uses the express-async-handler package to simplify error handling in asynchronous routes. You can later fill in your own business logic for each function.

Explanation
asyncHandler: This middleware wraps each asynchronous function and automatically passes any errors to the Express error handler.

Route Descriptions: Each controller function is commented with a description, HTTP method, route, and access level. This helps to maintain clarity especially as the project grows.

Function Skeletons: All functions have placeholders where you can implement your business logic. The responses are simply sample messages that you would replace with actual functionality such as interacting with a database.
