Integrating the getTransactionByloan controller.

Here's an explanation of the `getTransactionByLoan` controller in 10 lines:

1. This function handles requests to retrieve all transactions linked to a specific loan.
2. It first extracts the `loanId` from the route parameters.
3. It validates that the `loanId` is a valid MongoDB ObjectId using a regex check.
4. If the `loanId` is invalid, it sends a 400 Bad Request error.
5. It then queries the `Transaction` collection for records where the `loan` field matches the given `loanId`.
6. The result is populated with user details like `name` and `email` for better context.
7. If no transactions are found, it returns a 404 error with a message.
8. If transactions are found, it returns them in a JSON response.
9. The response includes a count of transactions and the transaction data.
10. The route is intended for admin access to monitor loan-related financial activity.
