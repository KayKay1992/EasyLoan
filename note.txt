Get  user profile function integration in auth controller

The getUserProfile function fetches the current user's profile from the database using the user's ID stored in req.user.id (set by the authentication middleware).

It excludes the password field from the result using .select('-password') for security and returns a 404 error if the user is not found.

If the user exists, it returns the user profile data as a JSON response.
