Integrating createSettings controller

Here's a 10-line explanation of the createSettings controller:

The controller handles the creation of initial system settings for the loan platform.

It is protected and intended for admin use only, ensuring only authorized users configure global settings.

It first checks the database to see if a settings document already exists.

If settings already exist, it returns a 400 Bad Request to prevent duplication.

If no settings are found, it reads values like interestRate, loanTermOptions, etc., from the request body.

It then creates a new Settings document in the database using these values.

Default values (like interest rate 5%) from the schema apply if not all fields are provided.

After saving, it returns a 201 Created status with a success message and the created settings.

This logic ensures only one system-wide configuration exists at any time.

It's foundational for consistent interest calculation, penalties, and loan term validation in the app..
