Admin Dashboard Summary section

Here’s a 10-line explanation of the **loan dashboard summary section**:

1. The component is wrapped in `DashboardLayout` with "Dashboard" set as the active menu.
2. A greeting message displays the current user's name and today’s date using `moment()`.
3. Inside a responsive grid, four `InfoCard` components summarize loan data.
4. Each `InfoCard` shows a category like "Total Loans", "Approved Loans", etc.
5. The values are pulled from `dashboardData?.charts?.loanDistribution` using optional chaining.
6. `addThousandsSeparator()` formats numbers (e.g., 1000 → 1,000) for better readability.
7. Each card uses a different color (`bg-primary`, `bg-green-500`, etc.) for visual distinction.
8. The layout is responsive using Tailwind CSS (`grid-cols-2`, `md:grid-cols-4`, etc.).
9. Data is expected to be fetched before this render, typically using a `useEffect` hook.
10. This section provides a high-level overview of loan activity for admins at a glance.
