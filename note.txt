Integrating getNotificationById controller

Sure! Here's a 10-line explanation of the getNotificationById controller:

The controller fetches a specific notification using its ID from the request parameters.

It uses Notification.findById() to query the database for that notification.

It calls .populate('user', 'name email') to include basic user info (name and email).

It uses .populate('referenceId') to include the associated Loan or Repayment document.

The dynamic reference is resolved via the refPath: 'referenceModel' in the schema.

This ensures that the correct model (Loan or Repayment) is populated automatically.

If no matching notification is found, it returns a 404 error.

If found, it returns a success response along with the full notification object.

The populated data helps admins or users understand the context of the notification.

This controller is useful for viewing detailed info about a specific notification in the UI.
