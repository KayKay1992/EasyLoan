Integrating deleteNotification controller


Hereâ€™s a 10-line explanation of the `deleteNotification` controller:

1. It handles the deletion of a specific notification using its ID from the request URL.  
2. The notification ID is retrieved from `req.params.id`.  
3. The logged-in user's ID is obtained from `req.user._id`.  
4. It searches the database for the notification using `Notification.findById`.  
5. If the notification doesn't exist, a 404 error is returned.  
6. It checks if the user owns the notification or is an admin.  
7. If the user is unauthorized, a 403 error is thrown.  
8. If authorized, the notification is deleted using `deleteOne()`.  
9. A 200 success response is sent back with a message and the deleted ID.  
10. This ensures only rightful users or admins can delete notifications securely.
