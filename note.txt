CREATING LOANTTYPE DISTRIBUTION SECTION BAR CHART

in ADMINDASHBOARD file component we rendered a loantype distribution jsx block.

 This JSX block renders a section displaying a bar chart for loan type distribution.  
It wraps everything inside a container `<div>` with no specific styling class.  
Inside that, a `.card` div provides a styled container for the chart content.  
The header row includes a title ("Loan Type Distribution") aligned using Flexbox.  
Finally, it renders the `CustomBarChart` component and passes `barChartData` as a prop.
