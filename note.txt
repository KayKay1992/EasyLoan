Integrating express-async-handler 

🔁 What is asyncHandler?
asyncHandler is a middleware function from the express-async-handler package that helps you catch errors in async route handlers automatically.

🔎 What it does again?
It allows you to write cleaner async route controllers without try/catch blocks, by automatically handling errors from async functions.

🧠 Bonus: import it to your controllers
At the top of your controller file (like authController.js), import it:
const asyncHandler = require('express-async-handler'); if you are using require.

Then wrap your functions: e.g const loginUser = asyncHandler(async (req, res) => {
  // your async code here
});

🚀 Benefits
Clean & readable controllers

No repetitive try/catch

Catches all async errors (like DB fails, undefined data, etc.)

Works well with centralized error handling middleware


we will use it next.
