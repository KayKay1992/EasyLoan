Integrating the updateTransaction controller.

Here’s a 12-line explanation of the `updateTransaction` controller:

1. It’s an Express async controller that handles updating a transaction by ID.  
2. It extracts the transaction ID from the route params and fields to update from the request body.  
3. Only specific fields (`amount`, `type`, `status`, `method`) are allowed to be updated.  
4. It validates that the fields provided are among the allowed ones.  
5. If invalid fields are detected, it throws an error.  
6. It fetches the transaction from the database using the ID.  
7. If the transaction doesn't exist, it returns a 404 error.  
8. It performs strict validation for each allowed field (e.g., `amount` must be a positive number).  
9. It also checks that `type`, `status`, and `method` match expected enums.  
10. Once validated, it updates only the allowed fields.  
11. It saves the transaction to the database.  
12. Finally, it returns a success message with the updated transaction.
