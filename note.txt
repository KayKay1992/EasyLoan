Integrating getRepaymentByLoan controller

✅ 10-Line Explanation:
This controller fetches all repayments tied to a specific loan ID.

It populates both the loan and the user who made each repayment.

If no repayments exist, it throws a 404 error to notify that none were found.

It calculates the total amount paid for that loan by summing all repayments.

The repayment balance is only shown if the loan is still active.

All monetary amounts are rounded to avoid decimals.

The data is structured into a clean response showing loan info and payments.

Each repayment includes who made it, how much, when, and how.

This is useful for admins reviewing a specific loan’s payment history.

It can also be reused for user-facing views to see repayment progress per loan.
