Register user function integration auth controller

explain the code

The registerUser function handles user registration by first extracting the name, email, password, profileImageUrl, and adminInviteToken from the request body.

It checks if the user already exists by querying the database for a matching email, and if found, returns a 400 error.

The user's role is determined based on the presence of an admin invite token, setting the role to 'admin' if valid, otherwise defaulting to 'user'.

The password is hashed using bcrypt for secure storage.

After successfully creating the new user, it returns the user data along with a JWT token for authentication in the response.
